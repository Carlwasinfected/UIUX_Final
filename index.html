              There are many distractions in this day and age, in the form of
              video games, TV shows, streaming websites, etc. Although
              distractions can enrich our daily lives, it might also make it
              hard for people to focus on their job or studies, which leads to
              procrastination. If you feel like you have not been productive
              enough due to distractions around you, AN·TIC·I·PATE aims to
              provide solutions to address these very problems. With
              AN·TIC·I·PATE, we hope to
              <strong>keep productivity maximized</strong> for all our users.

              minutes to complete. Our primary goal from these interviews was to

              on their breaks.Once we had finished our interviews, we had a team

              We highlighted important information from each interview and tried
              to group them. We went through different grouping processes until
              we narrowed them down into five main categories with multiple
              subcategories, resulting in three layers of notes for our data.

                  and their play time.</strong
                ><br />
                Many interviewees noted that they liked to schedule work time
                blocks and non-work time blocks. During those work blocks they
                would try to be as productive as possible on work and not use
                other applications or devices to break focus. However, this also
                results quickly in mental fatigue and people will be inclined to
                take more breaks to relax themselves.

                <br />
                We asked our participants to briefly check and describe their
                Screen Time on their phones, and the majority of them happen to
                use a lot of social media and entertainment applications, like
                Tiktok and Instagram. Social networking introduces plenty of
                opportunities for fear of missing out (FOMO), and it leads to
                people picking up their devices to check social media more often
                than not.

                <br />
                There were also a number of participants that would meticulously
                plan out their day, and review their tasks at the end of the
                day. We found that these same people also were more productive
                and did not feel tired or stressed at the end of the day because
                their schedule was “just right”.

                </strong>
                <br />
                Some interviewees indicated that they have used tools like
                calendars, reminders, alarm clock and Notion, a website that
                help users organize jobs, to keep themselves on track of their
                schedules.

                <br />

                We found that most people seemed to power through the day
                staying productive if they began the day by first exercising,
                doing housework, or simply just planning out their day. One
                interviewee said, “Once I start working, it is hard to stop.”
                People also tend to complete easy tasks before they start
                working on the hard tasks.

                Some of the older participants found it difficult to manage
                technology, and preferred time scheduling the manual way -- pen,
                paper and post-it notes. Many participants also mentioned that
                they have not used a habit tracker before, some of which was
                because it was confusing and hard to use.

              We first brainstormed to simulate different workflows based on the insights and user stories we concluded previously. 
              Then discussed the wireframes we needed and create the prototype on Figma.
              After that, we applied Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics rules to analyze our prototype, which allowed us to discover and evaluate potential usability issues.

              After creating the wireframes, we each had 2 participants perform
              several tasks on the wireframes as part of our user evaluation
              process to find issues. These issues were used to improve the
              fidelity of the wireframe into a higher-fidelity prototype, as
              shown below. The tasks the users were asked to perform were a mix
              of broad reflective tasks and specific goal-oriented tasks:

                While on the Work Timer Original State page, what do you think

              </li>
              <li>
                Could you start, stop, and reset the timer? After that, try to
                enter the break phase.
              </li>
              <li>
                While on the Work Timer Original State page, could you take a
                look at the page in front of you and tell me what you can do on
                this page?
              </li>
              <li>
                Could you please add one task to the to-do list, try to change
                its information, give it a difficulty of 10, then delete the

              used the result to construct our high-fidelity prototype. After

              After extensive user research, ideation, usability testing, and
              iterations, we aimed to design a system that helps people stay
              focused while they are working, while guiding them to stay
              productive while they're taking a break. Our goal can be achieved
              by implementing the <strong>Pomodoro technique</strong>, a
              technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
              traditionally 25 minutes in length, intervened with short breaks.
              During the break period, activities will be recommended for users
              to do with our state-of-the-art recommendation system. The
              activities can be either defined by users themselves or randomly
              suggested by our application.

              me so much. I also really appreciate my teammates, randomly
              assigned by Professor Matt and TAs. Joshua is a great teammate. He
              always takes the burden as a leader in the first half of the
              spring quarter. Joshua always comes up with great ideas and thanks
              for pushing us to finish the homework as early as possible.
              Yin-Jui is an excellent teammate, who teaches me a lot during the
              spring quarter. He is my best friend now. Finally, I still want to
              thank Professor for connecting us magically.

              Ruokun Xu: I am grateful to Professor Matt for his teaching this quarter.
              At the beginning of the course, I had some doubts about Prof.Matt's requirements because
              I feel individual creativity is limited by those requirements. But with Prof. Matt's guidance,
              I understood the meaning of the design requirements and logic that Prof.Matt
              wanted us to understand. Some things are not as naive as I thought. Prof.Matt
              taught me that a scientific design flow helps us blueprint superior user experiences.

              Xinnan Wu: I really want to say thank you to Professor Matt, TA Ethan
              and Yang for the supports and guidance you gave to me and our team this
              quarter. I still remembered in the first lecture I did not what Figma
              is when other classmates were discussing this UX design tool. But after
              one quarter's lecture and projects, I am able to getting a peek of what
              UX designers are doing in the real world and the tools they use for design
              and analysis. Thank you for making the knowledge easy to understand and
              accessible to us.
