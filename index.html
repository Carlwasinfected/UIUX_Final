              During a trip, a group of people often have the need of splitting
              bills with others. Our project’s current problem is: How can we
              split bills effectively and accurately, and how can we make our
              application track user’s every payment in detail to help them
              better control their total expense?
              Our group is going to design a spilt bill application, BuckFly.
              The main function of BuckFly is helping people calculate bills automatically,
              giving itemized information and the amount each person needs to pay or receive.

              Each member of our team conducted three one-on-one interviews and
              finished nine interviews in total. Each interview took around 30
              minutes to complete. Our primary goal from these interviews was to
              understand whether our participants have the need of bill splitting
              with others, the problem they met during the bill splitting and whether
              they used any software or application to help them with their bill.
              Once we had finished our interviews, we had several team meetings to
              assemble an affinity diagram and analyze our findings. We highlighted
              important information from each interview and found three insights.

              People who are under 40 with active bill-splitting needs usually
              use digital note-keeping tools to maintain bill records. But they
              usually feel it tedious if it takes them more than 30 seconds to
              create a new transaction every time, let alone a lot of typing work
              required. The interviewees we have constantly mentioned they wish there
              is a way to note bills quickly and without taking too much effort.

              <br />
              It is terrible to manage all bills for one person who was elected and
              responsible to record and calculate expenses for the group. The elected
              person might make mistakes or omissions that cause other people’s concerns.
              Therefore, if everyone in the group can participate in the process of
              recording and calculating the expenses, everyone is not required to do much
              and can spread the responsibility evenly among everyone.

              </strong>
              <br />
              People who pay bills for a group often want reminders in some way
              to remind the group when some group members fail to pay the bill in
              a certain period of time. So that the people who pay the bills in
              advance could get their money back in time.

              We created a Storyboard that a group of people go out to travel.
              One of the group members choose the rental car for the group, and
              used his own credit card to pay the rental fee for the whole group.
              He is really unhappy when spending this large amount of money and
              other group members haven't paid him back.

              We first brainstormed to simulate different workflows based on the insights and user stories we concluded previously. 
              Then discussed the wireframes we needed and create the prototype on Figma.
              After that, we applied Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics rules to analyze our prototype, which allowed us to discover and evaluate potential usability issues.

              After creating the wireframes, we each had 2 participants perform
              several tasks on the wireframes as part of our user evaluation
              process to find issues. These issues were used to improve the
              fidelity of the wireframe into a higher-fidelity prototype, as
              shown below. The tasks the users were asked to perform were a mix
              of broad reflective tasks and specific goal-oriented tasks:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Set up your user account, including activities and distractions.
              </li>
              <li>
                While on the Work Timer Original State page, what do you think
                about the setup process?
              </li>
              <li>
                Could you start, stop, and reset the timer? After that, try to
                enter the break phase.
              </li>
              <li>
                While on the Work Timer Original State page, could you take a
                look at the page in front of you and tell me what you can do on
                this page?
              </li>
              <li>
                Could you please add one task to the to-do list, try to change
                its information, give it a difficulty of 10, then delete the
                task?

              Based on the findings of the user evaluations, we compiled a list
              of usability issues, which we then fixed in our wireframe, and
              used the result to construct our high-fidelity prototype. After
              that, we individually compiled our own list of usability issues
              based on the

              After extensive user research, ideation, usability testing, and
              iterations, we aimed to design a system that helps people stay
              focused while they are working, while guiding them to stay
              productive while they're taking a break. Our goal can be achieved
              by implementing the <strong>Pomodoro technique</strong>, a
              technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
              traditionally 25 minutes in length, intervened with short breaks.
              During the break period, activities will be recommended for users
              to do with our state-of-the-art recommendation system. The
              activities can be either defined by users themselves or randomly
              suggested by our application.

          As a team, we worked well together for every milestone and design
          process. We took advantages of teammate's idea during researches and
          read other teammate's report to help us perform better in the next
          step. We encouraged each other when met difficulties such as narrowing
          down interview questions and consolidating insights. We are proud
          of our work and achievement in these 11 weeks. We are also grateful
          to Professor Matt and TAs who help us learn this much.

              me so much. I also really appreciate my teammates, randomly
              assigned by Professor Matt and TAs. Joshua is a great teammate. He
              always takes the burden as a leader in the first half of the
              spring quarter. Joshua always comes up with great ideas and thanks
              for pushing us to finish the homework as early as possible.
              Yin-Jui is an excellent teammate, who teaches me a lot during the
              spring quarter. He is my best friend now. Finally, I still want to
              thank Professor for connecting us magically.

              Ruokun Xu: I am grateful to Professor Matt for his teaching this quarter.
              At the beginning of the course, I had some doubts about Prof.Matt's requirements because
              I feel individual creativity is limited by those requirements. But with Prof. Matt's guidance,
              I understood the meaning of the design requirements and logic that Prof.Matt
              wanted us to understand. Some things are not as naive as I thought. Prof.Matt
              taught me that a scientific design flow helps us blueprint superior user experiences.

              Xinnan Wu: I really want to say thank you to Professor Matt, TA Ethan
              and Yang for the supports and guidance you gave to me and our team this
              quarter. I still remembered in the first lecture I did not what Figma
              is when other classmates were discussing this UX design tool. But after
              one quarter's lecture and projects, I am able to getting a peek of what
              UX designers are doing in the real world and the tools they use for design
              and analysis. Thank you for making the knowledge easy to understand and
              accessible to us.
